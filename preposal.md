# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Python dating simulator built in RenPy; short-ish visual novel dating sim with multiple routes (hopefully)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Since this project will be created in RenPy, how will the code be graded? Will you grade based on substance, or based on the quality of the code--or some mix in between?
