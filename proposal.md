# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snake Charmer: A Python Dating Simulator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A visual novel-style game that lets you romance a humanized version of your favorite programming language, Python.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be primarily constructed in RenPy. Though I don't fully know the logistics of RenPy yet, I can assume it will allow me to create my game in a standard visual novel-type format. If everything goes as planned, there will be alternative routes that the player can follow, think choose-your-own-adventure style where your choices and responses to situations matter. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A fully produced and written route, meaning the game is fully functioning, although does not have the splitting paths/crossroads aspect usually found in VNs

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

At least two routes for the player to go down, 30+ minutes of gameplay each route, fully colored sprites drawn by myself

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

At least three routes, 2 hours of runtime in total (for all routes), implementation of easter eggs and a hidden route, potentially making my own music for the game (though it will be rather barebones)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use RenPy, potentially how to make simple chiptune songs, research documentation of RenPy and sprite implementation/route selection, how to create sprites (using procreate)
